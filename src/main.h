/*
 * So the purpose of this program is basically a game.

 * It will be essentially a turn-based game.

 * They will be able to select their player type, this is enumerated. There will be a hidden character that is only unlocked when you beat the boss with
   all of the characters. However, I am going to try to set the exploit up such that they will be able to unlock this character and be able to use him.

 * They will be able to select their move set as well. They will need to type that out. This is not where the exploit is tho.

 * It will work by allowing the user to enter their name. I plan to perform the exploit there.
